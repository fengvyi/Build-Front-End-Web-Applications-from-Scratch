## Minesweeper
A console based minesweeper game.

### Features to add
* Add validation to ensure that board dimensions make sense. For example, a board should not be able to be created with more bombs than it has tiles.
* Add a timer which lets players know how long it took them to win (or lose).
* Add recursive flipping, when a tile is flipped that isn't touching a bomb (would have the number zero printed on it), all adjacent tiles additionally flip over.
* Add a method to place flags at a tile instead of flipping that tile. If a square has a flag on it, it can't be flipped over.

### Features to add
* Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
* Make images clickable and have them open the business' website in a new tab
* Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click "Let's Go" again
* Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
* Allow you to search by pressing "Enter" (or "Return") on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
* Add autocompletion of addresses to the "Location" input
